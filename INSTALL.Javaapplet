# Basic Installation of Java 
==================

Dasher makes use of the GNU autotools system (automake, autoconf
etc.), which are described in the 'INSTALL' file.  The following is
specific to building and installing Dasher on JAVA.  The Dasher
maintainer documentation is at http://live.gnome.org/Dasher.

## !IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE STARTING

This project builds an applet, not a standalone application.

This is all obviously quite old, and some modern browsers (notably Chrome and Edge) don't support Java applets anymore. However, as of the time of writing 
(and checking https://superuser.com/questions/1213341/how-to-get-a-browser-that-supports-java), Internet Explorer and Firefox ESR should still be able to show JDasher.


Let's try the easy route first:

    Install Java 8 or Higher
        On Windows and Linux, install the latest JRE 8 from Oracle.
        On macOS, download and install JDK 8.

    Install Gradle 
	Clone it using Git: 
		$ git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-gradle.git
	
	cd into gs-gradle/initial
	
	Install SDKMAN(The Software Development Kit Manager)
		
		Simply open a new terminal and enter: 
		$ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash

		Follow the instructions on-screen to complete installation.
		Next, open a new terminal or enter:
		$ source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
		
		Lastly, run the following code snippet to ensure that installation succeeded:
		$ sdk version
		
		If all went well, the version should be displayed. Something like:
		sdkman 5.0.0+51
	
	Install Gradle 4.6

		$ sdk install gradle 4.6

	To test the Gradle installation, run Gradle from the command-line:
		$ gradle

	If all goes well, you see a welcome message:
		:help

		Welcome to Gradle 2.3.

		To run a build, run gradle <task> ...

		To see a list of available tasks, run gradle tasks

		To see a list of command-line options, run gradle --help

		BUILD SUCCESSFUL

		Total time: 2.675 secs

	Cd into dasher/java

		$ gradle build 

	Build you project with Gradle Wrapper

		$ gradle wrapper --gradle-version 2.13

		$ ./gradlew build
	
	Running Project
		https://github.com/dasher-project/dasher/blob/master/java/src/main/java/dasher/applet/JDasherApplet.java is the entry point.

		https://github.com/dasher-project/dasher/blob/master/java/src/main/java/dasher/applet/test.htm shows how you run that from within an HTML page.
